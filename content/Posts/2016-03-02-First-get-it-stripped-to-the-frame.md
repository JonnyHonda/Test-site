Title: First get it stripped to the frame

First job was to get this thing stripped to the frame, everything out and off, beauty of the k100 is that it is
very "modular" and it comes apart very easily, you don't get a great deal of those seized bolts in castings due to dissimilar metals.

Quality counts I guess.
